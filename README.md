# Photon Transport Simulation using Monte Carlo Method

This project implements a Monte Carlo algorithm in C++ to simulate the transport of photons through water. It models the interactions of photons as they scatter, lose energy, and possibly get absorbed within the medium, providing detailed insights into the trajectory and energy deposition of particles.

## Project Overview

photon transport simulations are used to understand how photons interact with different materials, which is crucial for applications in radiation therapy, nuclear physics, and experimental research. By employing the Monte Carlo method, the simulation generates random samples to statistically replicate the physical interactions, accounting for complex probabilistic behaviors.

### Key Features
- **Monte Carlo Algorithm**: Utilizes random sampling techniques to simulate particle transport.
- **Interaction Models**: Includes physical models for scattering, energy loss, and absorption processes.
- **Photon Trajectory Analysis**: Tracks and visualizes the photon's path through the medium.
- **Energy Deposition**: Calculates energy deposition profiles, which are essential for understanding the effect of photons in the medium.

### Future Enhancements
- Integration of additional interaction types such as nuclear reactions.
- Visualization tools to display simulation results.
- Parallel computing support to enhance performance.

### Prerequisites
- C++17 or later.
- Basic knowledge of Monte Carlo methods and particle physics.
- A compiler supporting C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang).
